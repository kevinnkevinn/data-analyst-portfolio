ARC-AGI: A Challenge in Artificial General Intelligence
This repository focuses on the ARC-AGI competition, which aims to advance research in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Current AI systems struggle with new problems and lack the ability to learn and invent like humans.

The Challenge:

The ARC-AGI benchmark tests an AI's ability to learn new skills efficiently. Humans excel in this area, scoring 85% compared to the best AI systems at 34%. This competition offers a $600,000 prize pool to incentivize researchers to develop solutions that surpass human performance (85%) on the ARC-AGI benchmark. Winning solutions will be open-sourced to benefit the entire AGI community.

What I will Do:

By participating in this challenge, you can contribute to the development of next-generation AI with broad-ranging applications across industries.

Key Points:

Focus: Improving AI's ability to learn and solve novel problems.
Evaluation: Measured by percentage of correct predictions on the ARC-AGI benchmark.
Submission Format: JSON file named submission.json with specific structure (see "Submission File" section for details).
Prize: $600,000 with additional opportunities outside of Kaggle (visit ARCprize.org for more information).
Open Source: Winning solutions will be shared publicly to promote collaboration and progress in AGI research.
