# CZII - CryoET Object Identification

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition "CZII - CryoET Object Identification." The goal of this competition is to identify small biological structures within large 3D volumes using electron microscopy data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 3D images with annotations for training and evaluation. The images are complex and require advanced techniques for effective object detection.

## Approach
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzed the dataset to understand its characteristics and challenges.
- **Modeling**: Developed deep learning models to detect and classify objects in the 3D images.
- **Evaluation**: Used appropriate metrics to assess model performance and ensure robustness.

## Installation
To run the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
bash git clone: https://github.com/kevinnkevinn/data-analyst-portfolio
2. Navigate to the project directory:
bash cd data-analyst-portfolio/CZII - CryoET Object Identification
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
bash jupyter notebook
