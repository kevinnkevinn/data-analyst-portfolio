CIBMTR - Equity in Post-HCT Survival Predictions
Overview
In this competition, I will develop models to improve the prediction of transplant survival rates for patients undergoing allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT). This is an important step...

Description
Improving survival predictions for allogeneic HCT patients is a vital healthcare challenge. Current predictive models often fall short in addressing disparities related to socioeconomic status, race,...

This competition encourages participants to advance predictive modeling by ensuring that survival predictions are both precise and fair for patients across diverse groups. By using synthetic data...

Evaluation Criteria
The evaluation of prediction accuracy will involve a specialized metric known as the Stratified Concordance Index (C-index), adapted to consider different racial groups independently. This method...

Concordance Index
0.5: Expected result from random predictions
1.0: Perfect concordance
0.0: Perfect anti-concordance
Stratified Concordance Index
For this competition, the standard C-index is adjusted to account for racial stratification, ensuring that each racial group's outcomes are weighed equally in the model evaluation. The stratified C-index...

Submission File
Participants must submit their predictions for the test dataset as real-valued risk scores. The submission file must include a header and follow this format:

Code
ID,prediction
28800,0.5
28801,1.2
28802,0.8
etc.
Where:

ID: Identifier for each patient in the test dataset.
prediction: Corresponding risk score generated by your model.

Submission file must be named submission.csv
Background Information
What is Allogeneic HCT?
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) replaces an individual's faulty hematopoietic stem cells with healthy ones from a donor. This procedure can help fix a person's immune system by introducing...

The source of hematopoietic stem cells can be bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. Depending on the source, HCT procedures may be called bone marrow transplants (BMT), peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT), or umbilical cord blood transplants (CBT)...

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 59 variables related to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), encompassing a range of demographic and medical characteristics of both recipients and donors, such as age, sex, race, disease characteristics, and transplant-related variables...

Files
train.csv: The training set, with target efs (Event-free survival)
test.csv: The test set; your task is to predict the value of efs for this data
sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file in the correct format with all predictions set to 0.50
data_dictionary.csv: A list of all features and targets used in the dataset and their descriptions
Important Note
The rerun test data contains approximately the same number of observations as the training data.
