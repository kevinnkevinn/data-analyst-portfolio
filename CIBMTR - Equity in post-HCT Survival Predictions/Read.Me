In the CIBMTR - Equity in Post-HCT Survival Predictions competition, participants are tasked with developing models to enhance the prediction of transplant survival rates for patients undergoing allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT). 
This initiative aims to address disparities related to socioeconomic status, race, and geography, ensuring equitable outcomes for all patients. The evaluation will utilize the Stratified Concordance Index (C-index), which assesses predictive performance across different racial groups. 
Participants must submit their predictions as real-valued risk scores in a specified format, with the submission file named submission.csv. The dataset includes various demographic and medical characteristics, with the primary outcome being event-free survival (efs). 
This competition emphasizes the importance of fair and accurate predictions in healthcare, ultimately contributing to improved patient care.
