# CIBMTR - Equity in Post-HCT Survival Predictions

# Overview

In this competition, I will develop models to improve the prediction of transplant survival rates for patients undergoing allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT). This is an important step in ensuring that every patient has a fair chance at a successful outcome, regardless of their background.

## Description

Improving survival predictions for allogeneic HCT patients is a vital healthcare challenge. Current predictive models often fall short in addressing disparities related to socioeconomic status, race, and geography. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing patient care, optimizing resource utilization, and rebuilding trust in the healthcare system.

This competition encourages participants to advance predictive modeling by ensuring that survival predictions are both precise and fair for patients across diverse groups. By using synthetic data—which mirrors real-world situations while protecting patient privacy—participants can build and improve models that more effectively consider diverse backgrounds and conditions.

## Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation of prediction accuracy will involve a specialized metric known as the **Stratified Concordance Index (C-index)**, adapted to consider different racial groups independently. This method allows us to gauge the predictive performance of models in a way that emphasizes equitability across diverse patient populations.

### Concordance Index

- **0.5**: Expected result from random predictions
- **1.0**: Perfect concordance
- **0.0**: Perfect anti-concordance

### Stratified Concordance Index

For this competition, the standard C-index is adjusted to account for racial stratification, ensuring that each racial group's outcomes are weighed equally in the model evaluation. The stratified C-index is calculated as the mean minus the standard deviation of the C-index scores calculated within the recipient race categories.

## Submission File

Participants must submit their predictions for the test dataset as real-valued risk scores. The submission file must include a header and follow this format:

ID,prediction
28800,0.5
28801,1.2
28802,0.8
etc.


Where:
- **ID**: Identifier for each patient in the test dataset.
- **prediction**: Corresponding risk score generated by your model.

## Code Requirements

This is a Code Competition. Submissions must be made through Notebooks. To ensure the "Submit" button is active after a commit, the following conditions must be met:

- **CPU Notebook**: ≤ 9 hours run-time
- **GPU Notebook**: ≤ 9 hours run-time
- Internet access disabled
- Freely & publicly available external data is allowed, including pre-trained models
- Submission file must be named `submission.csv`

## Background Information

### What is Allogeneic HCT?

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) replaces an individual's faulty hematopoietic stem cells with healthy ones from a donor. This procedure can help fix a person's immune system by introducing healthy stem cells into their body.

The source of hematopoietic stem cells can be bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. Depending on the source, HCT procedures may be called bone marrow transplants (BMT), peripheral blood stem cell transplants, or cord blood transplants.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 59 variables related to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), encompassing a range of demographic and medical characteristics of both recipients and donors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, disease status, and treatment details. The primary outcome of interest is event-free survival, represented by the variable `efs`, while the time to event-free survival is captured by the variable `efs_time`.

### Files

- **train.csv**: The training set, with target `efs` (Event-free survival)
- **test.csv**: The test set; your task is to predict the value of `efs` for this data
- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample submission file in the correct format with all predictions set to 0.50
- **data_dictionary.csv**: A list of all features and targets used in the dataset and their descriptions

## Important Note

The rerun test data contains approximately the same number of observations as the training data.
