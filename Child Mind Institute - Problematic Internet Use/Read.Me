HBN Dataset: Predicting Problematic Internet Use (README.md)
This repository contains data for a competition focused on predicting problematic internet use in children and adolescents. The data comes from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) study, which collected information from participants aged 5-22 years old.

Goal:

Develop a model to predict the Severity Impairment Index (sii) based on physical activity and internet usage data. The sii is a standard measure of problematic internet use, ranging from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe).

Data:

The data is split into two sources:

Parquet Files (Actigraphy): These files contain continuous accelerometer data collected by wrist-worn trackers. Each file (series_{train|test}.parquet/id={id}) represents data for a single participant.
CSV Files (Tabular Data): These files contain various measurements from different instruments, including demographics, internet use surveys, fitness assessments, and health questionnaires. The relevant fields and descriptions are provided in data_dictionary.csv.
Key Points:

The target variable (sii) is missing for a portion of the training data. Consider using non-supervised learning techniques.
The sii is derived from the PCIAT-PCIAT_Total field in the train.csv and test.csv files, as detailed in the data_dictionary.csv.
The actigraphy data includes various measures like step count, acceleration along axes, wear/non-wear flags, and environmental sensors (light, battery voltage).
Provided Files:

train.csv: Tabular data for training participants.
test.csv: Tabular data for testing participants (sii included).
data_dictionary.csv: Instrument and field descriptions.
series_{train|test}.parquet: Actigraphy data for training and testing.
sample_submission.csv: Example submission format for predicted sii values.
