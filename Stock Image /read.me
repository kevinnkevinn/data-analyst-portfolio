The task of Stock Price Prediction involves the use of modeling techniques and models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to predict stock prices in the market. Through the analysis of historical data, these models seek to identify patterns and trends associated with stock price movements, allowing investors and stock traders to make more informed decisions. The goal is to obtain accurate predictions of future stock prices, allowing stakeholders in the stock market to take appropriate steps in investment, risk management, and trading strategies. In this assignment, data processing, exploration, and modeling using RNNs are the main focus in an effort to generate reliable and useful predictions in the context of stock trading.
