Read Me - Child Mind Institute: Problematic Internet Use Analysis
This code is designed to participate in the Kaggle competition titled "Child Mind Institute â€” Problematic Internet Use". The competition aims to predict the Severity Impairment Index (SII) of participants based on a combination of physical activity and internet usage data.

Problem Statement:

Excessive internet use can negatively impact mental health, particularly among young people. This competition seeks to develop a model that utilizes readily available data (physical activity and internet habits) to predict the severity of problematic internet use in participants.

Data Description:

The provided dataset consists of two main sources:

CSV files: These files contain tabular data on various metrics, including demographics, internet usage, physical measures, fitness assessments, and health questionnaires.
Parquet files: These files store accelerometer data collected from participants wearing wrist-worn trackers for up to 30 days.
Target Variable:

The target variable for this competition is the Severity Impairment Index (SII), which categorizes internet use severity into four levels:

0: None
1: Mild
2: Moderate
3: Severe
The SII is derived from the "PCIAT-PCIAT_Total" field within the "Parent-Child Internet Addiction Test" instrument.

Analysis Goal:

The primary goal of this code is to develop a model that analyzes both physical activity data (from accelerometer readings) and internet usage data (from questionnaires) to predict a participant's SII. This model can potentially be used to identify youth at risk of problematic internet use, allowing for early intervention and improved mental health outcomes.

Code Structure:

This code is expected to encompass functionalities for:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and potentially feature engineering for both the tabular data and accelerometer data.
Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the accelerometer data that might be indicative of physical activity levels.
Model development: Building a machine learning model that effectively combines features from both data sources to predict the SII. This could involve techniques like feature fusion or multi-modal learning.
Model evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on a hold-out test set using metrics appropriate for regression or classification tasks (depending on the chosen model architecture).
Expected Outcome:

This code should produce a model capable of accurately predicting the SII based on the provided data. This model can be submitted to the Kaggle competition for evaluation against other participants' solutions.

Additional Notes:

The competition involves a hidden test set, meaning the actual data used for evaluation won't be available during development. However, the provided sample data allows for training and refining the model.
Unsupervised learning techniques might be necessary to handle missing data in the training set.
