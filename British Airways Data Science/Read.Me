British Airways (BA) is the United Kingdom's (UK) national airline. Every day, thousands of British Airways flights arrive and depart from the United Kingdom, transporting passengers from around the globe. The end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fueling, transporting, landing, and perpetually operating flights on time, efficiently, and with top-notch customer service is a massive undertaking with numerous crucial responsibilities, regardless of whether the flights are for business or pleasure.

As a data scientist at BA, it will be your responsibility to use your analytical skills to influence real-world, multimillion-pound decisions from day one, having a measurable impact on the organisation as your recommendations, tools, and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs, and increase revenue.

When booking a flight with British Airways, customers will have multiple interactions with the brand. Understanding a customer's emotions, requirements, and feedback is essential to the success of any business, including BA.

This first task involves scraping and accumulating consumer feedback, reviewing data from a third-party source, and analysing and presenting any insights uncovered from this data.
